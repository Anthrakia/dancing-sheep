#summary The Client/Server Protocol

= Introduction =

The client and the server communicate with HTTP.  The server replies with XML structured data, images, and animations.

= Details =

When the client is installed it generates a 8-byte random unique ID, written with hex digits, eg FDB1C06A94A0FC87.  It is passed to all subsequent queries.

When the client starts up it makes a redirection query.  the resulting hostname is used for all subsequent queries.  The redirection is cached.
